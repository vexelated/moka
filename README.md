# MOKA: Pomodoro Assistant
## Design Prototype
In developing this application, we created a prototype application design using [Figma](https://www.figma.com).
Here is a [link](https://www.figma.com/file/p63qALu5hQNAAKgzvOn900/MOKA---Study-Monitoring?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=kC9MRKSLbZbEJUnu-1) to our application design.

## Code Implementation
MOKA App, is a Native Android App that uses CameraX and implements Machine Learning Models directly in the app to detect sleepy faces in real-time. We also use a countdown timer for the Pomodoro Technique. This application will pop up a warning in the form of a dialog when the user is detected to be sleepy. In addition, we added a function to add tasks and display the task list and task history of the user using RecyclerView. We also added an edit profile feature for the user to change the user name.
